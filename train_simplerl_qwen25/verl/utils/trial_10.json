This is nothing but $100 + 87 + 60 - a - b - c$, or $247 - (a + b + c)$.\n\nTo solve the problem, we systematically test the options using elimination:\n\nLet's first check options A and B, since they only happen when $a,b,$ and $c$ sum to $35$ or $0$. We begin by testing three positive values, but none satisfy the equation when there is a plus sign. For example, $(12, 8, 4)$ satisfies $ab + c = 100$, but does not satisfy $bc + a = 87$, or $ac + b = 60$. If $a + b + c = 0$, then not all of the numbers can be positive or negative, so this would not work. From this observation, we conclude that the answer cannot be $A$ or $B$.\n\nNow let's test the next option, option $C$. Option $C$ states $ab + bc + ca = 258$. If true, then:\n\na + b + c = -11\n\nThis sum is too large. Furthermore, if all three numbers are negative, the solution still fails. For example, testing $(-4, -5, -2)$ confirms the equation is not satisfied, as we get results that are too small. Thus, we eliminate option $C$.\n\nFinally, let's test the last two options: $D$ and $E$. For option $E$, the sum $a + b + c$ would be:\n\n$247 - 284 = -37$\n\nTesting values such as $(-11, -12, -14)$, the resulting sums $ab + c$, $bc + a$, and $ac + b$ are far too large to satisfy the equation. Therefore, $E$ is also eliminated.\n\nOnce we have this answer, we still need to verify it by testing out numbers: Finally, we test option $D$. Using $ab + bc + ca = 276$, we get that $a + b + c = -29$. Also note that $a, b,$ and $c$ all have to be different, because the sums from the three equations are all different. We want to get the three closest values of $a, b,$ and $c$ such that they are all different, and the sum $a + b + c = -29$. The values $(-9, -12, -8)$ are the closest three numbers. When we try them, they satisfy all three equations. So, the correct answer is:\n\n$ab + ba + ac = -9 * -12 + -12 * -8 + -8 * -9 = \\boxed{(D)\\ 276}.$"]

Therefore, if one die shows a and Jason rerolls the other two dice, the probability of winning is (7−a−1)/36 = (6−a)/36.\n\nTo maximize this probability, a must be minimized, so if he rerolls two dice he should reroll the two dice with the largest values. Let a ≤ b ≤ c be the three values.\n\nCase 1: a+b<7. If a+b+c=7, do not reroll. Otherwise, if we reroll one die, we can choose any one die hoping to make the total 7; this has probability 1/6. If we reroll two dice, we reroll the two largest dice, and the probability is (6−a)/36 as above. But 1/6 > (6−a)/36, so with a+b<7 it is always better to reroll one die than two.\n\nCase 2: a+b≥7. Rerolling one die cannot give a total of 7 since the sum will exceed 7. If we reroll two dice, the probability is (6−a)/36.

Suppose that 7 balls are lined up in a row. There are 6 gaps between the balls, and placing dividers in 2 of the gaps separates the balls into 3 piles. From left to right, the numbers of balls in the piles correspond to a, b, and c, respectively. There are C(6,2) = 15 ways to place the dividers. Note that the dividers' positions and the ordered triples have one-to-one correspondence, and 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 6 holds for all such ordered triples.\n\nThe optimal strategy is that:\n• If Jason needs to reroll at least zero dice to win, then he rerolls exactly zero dice.\n• If Jason needs to reroll at least one die to win, then he rerolls exactly one die.\n• If Jason needs to reroll at least two dice to win, then he rerolls exactly two dice if and only if the probability of winning is greater than 5/72, the probability of winning for rerolling all three dice.\n\nThe first three cases in the table above satisfy this requirement. We will analyze these cases by considering the initial outcomes of the two dice rerolled.

Let \\(a\\) be the roll we keep. We know \\(a\\le 3\\) since \\(a=4\\) would cause Jason to pick up all the dice. When \\(a=1\\), there are 3 choices for whether it is rolled 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, and in this case the other two rolls have to be at least 6 (or he would have only picked up 1). This give \\(3\\cdot 1^2=3\\) ways. Similarly, \\(a=2\\) gives \\(3\\cdot 2^2=12\\). \\(a=3\\) gives \\(3\\cdot 3^2=27\\). Summing together gives the numerator of 42. The denominator is \\(6^3=216\\), so we have \\(\\frac{42}{216}=(A)\\;\\frac{7}{36}\\).",
            "We can quickly write out all possible rolls that result in a total of 7, to get that there is a \\(\\frac{5}{72}\\) chance that rolling three dice will result in a total of 7.\n\nClaim 1: If all of Jason's initial outcomes are 4, 5 or 6, Jason is best off rerolling everything.\n\nProof of if part: If Jason rerolls two dice, he would like for the sum of the two outcomes to be \\(7-\\) (The initial outcome of the untouched die). Since in this case, every dice's initial outcome is 4, 5 or 6, this value is 1, 2 or 3. By basic dice probability, the probability that they add to one is \\(\\frac{1}{36}\\); the probability that they add to two is 0; the probability that they add to three is \\(\\frac{1}{18}\\). Each of these probabilities is less than \\(\\frac{5}{72}\\), (the probability of winning by rerolling everything) so Jason should not reroll one dice in this scenario. Rolling one die is also nonsense in this situation, since the other two dice will already add up to something greater than 7.\n\nProof of only-if part: If Jason rolls a 1, 2 or 3, even just once, then the probability that rerolling the other two dice will result in win is \\(\\frac{5}{36}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{9}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\), by basic die probability. Each of these is greater than \\(\\frac{5}{72}\\), so if Jason rolls a 1, 2 or 3, he should not reroll everything.\n\nClaim 2: Iff the sum of any two of the initial dice is less than 7, Jason is best off rerolling one or zero die.\n\nProof of if part: If the sum of any two of the initial dice is less than 7, when the other die is rolled, there is always a fixed \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) chance that this results in a win for Jason (or, he his initial roll already won, so he doesn't have to roll anything). Rerolling that one die is better than rerolling all three dice, since, as we have seen there is a \\(\\frac{5}{72}\\) chance that Jason wins from that. Rerolling that one die is also better than rerolling two dice: by basic die probability, if Jason wishes for the sum of two rerolled dice to equal one value, the maximum probability this happens is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\), and this is when he wishes for the sum to be 7; however, since he wishes for the sum of all three die to be 7, this will never happen, so the probability that rerolling two dice results in a win is always less than \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\nProof of only-if part: If the sum of each pair of the three dice is at least 7, it would make no sense to reroll one die, since the final sum of all three dice will always be greater than 7. Also, if the sum of each pair of the three dice is at least 7, the total initial sum must also be greater than 7, so Jason should not reroll zero die.\n\nFrom having shown these two claims, we know that Jason should reroll two dice if at least one of them is a 1, 2 or 3, and if the sum of any two of the initial dice is at least 7. We can write out all the possibilities of initial rolls, account for their permutations, and add everything together to see that there are 42 total outcomes, where Jason should reroll two dice. Therefore, our final answer is \\(\\frac{42}{216}=(A)\\;\\frac{7}{36}\\).",
            "If the sum of the dice is 7, we reroll no dice. If the sum of any two dice is \\(\\le 6\\), we reroll 1 die because rolling 1 die will give Jason a \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) chance of winning. Thus, we consider the scenario where the sum of any two dice is 7 or greater.\n\nIf the smallest die is 1, the other two dice must be 6, which has 3 possible permutations.\n\nIf the smallest die is 2, the other two dice can be 5 or 6. There are 3 ways to choose the position of the smallest die, 2 ways each to choose the value of the other dice, so there are \\(2\\cdot 2\\cdot 3=12\\) possible permutations.\n\nIf the smallest die is 3, the other two dice can be 4, 5, or 6. Similarly, there are 3 ways to choose the position of the smallest die, and 3 ways each to choose the value of the other dice, so there are \\(3\\cdot 3\\cdot 3=27\\) possible permutations.\n\nIf all die are 4 or above, then we reroll 3 dice. When we reroll all 3 dice, the winning rolls are 1,1,5; 1,2,4; 1,3,3; 2,2,3 in some arrangement, for a total of 15 permutations. Thus, the probability of winning after rerolling 3 dice is \\(\\frac{15}{6^3}=\\frac{5}{72}\\). If we reroll only 2 dice with the smallest die being 4, we would need to roll 1,2 or 2,1 to win, which gives a \\(\\frac{2}{36}=\\frac{4}{72}\\) chance of winning, so this is worse.\n\nIf the smallest die is 5 or 6, rerolling 2 dice gives us even worse odds.\n\nTherefore, the cases where 1, 2, or 3 are the smallest die covers all cases where 2 rerolls is optimal. There are \\(3+12+27=42\\) permutations out of 216 total permutations, giving us a probability of \\(\\frac{42}{216}=\\frac{7}{36}\\)."]
