This is nothing but $100 + 87 + 60 - a - b - c$, or $247 - (a + b + c)$.\n\nTo solve the problem, we systematically test the options using elimination:\n\nLet's first check options A and B, since they only happen when $a,b,$ and $c$ sum to $35$ or $0$. We begin by testing three positive values, but none satisfy the equation when there is a plus sign. For example, $(12, 8, 4)$ satisfies $ab + c = 100$, but does not satisfy $bc + a = 87$, or $ac + b = 60$. If $a + b + c = 0$, then not all of the numbers can be positive or negative, so this would not work. From this observation, we conclude that the answer cannot be $A$ or $B$.\n\nNow let's test the next option, option $C$. Option $C$ states $ab + bc + ca = 258$. If true, then:\n\na + b + c = -11\n\nThis sum is too large. Furthermore, if all three numbers are negative, the solution still fails. For example, testing $(-4, -5, -2)$ confirms the equation is not satisfied, as we get results that are too small. Thus, we eliminate option $C$.\n\nFinally, let's test the last two options: $D$ and $E$. For option $E$, the sum $a + b + c$ would be:\n\n$247 - 284 = -37$\n\nTesting values such as $(-11, -12, -14)$, the resulting sums $ab + c$, $bc + a$, and $ac + b$ are far too large to satisfy the equation. Therefore, $E$ is also eliminated.\n\nOnce we have this answer, we still need to verify it by testing out numbers: Finally, we test option $D$. Using $ab + bc + ca = 276$, we get that $a + b + c = -29$. Also note that $a, b,$ and $c$ all have to be different, because the sums from the three equations are all different. We want to get the three closest values of $a, b,$ and $c$ such that they are all different, and the sum $a + b + c = -29$. The values $(-9, -12, -8)$ are the closest three numbers. When we try them, they satisfy all three equations. So, the correct answer is:\n\n$ab + ba + ac = -9 * -12 + -12 * -8 + -8 * -9 = \\boxed{(D)\\ 276}.$"]

        "Consider this diagram:\n\nFirst, the one of points must be in the uppermost box and the other in the rightmost box. This happens with probability $\\dfrac{2}{3}*\\dfrac{1}{3}=\\dfrac{2}{9}$.\n\nWe need the midpoints of the $x$ coordinates to be greater than $1$ but less than $2$.\n\nWe need the midpoints of the $y$ coordinates to be greater than $1$ but less than $2$.\n\nThus, we set up:\n\n$$\n1 < \\dfrac{x_1 + x_2}{2} < 2\n$$\n$$\n1 < \\dfrac{y_1 + y_2}{2} < 2\n$$\n\nUsing geometric probability, as shown below, we get that the probability of happening is $\\dfrac{1}{2}$. This is for both. So we have probability $\\dfrac{1}{2}*\\dfrac{1}{2}=\\dfrac{1}{4}$.\n\nUsing geometric probability, as shown below, we get that the probability of happening is $\\dfrac{1}{2}$. This is for both. So we have probability $\\dfrac{1}{2}*\\dfrac{1}{2}=\\dfrac{1}{4}$.\n\nThus, the fraction is $1-(\\dfrac{2}{9}*\\dfrac{1}{4})=1-\\dfrac{1}{18}=\\dfrac{17}{18}$.\n\nThe answer is $17+18=35$",
        "We casework on the squares the two points are in. Unless the two squares are on opposite corners, which happens with probability $\\frac{2}{9}$. If the points are on opposite corners, the points must be on the upper half of the splitting diagonal for the midpoint to not be in the square. This occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$. We take the complement and get final answer $(\\frac{2}{9})(\\frac{3}{4})+(\\frac{7}{9})=\\frac{17}{18}$."]
